# F1-Pulse
 This is a website for basic information about Formula 1 drivers!

 The goal is to eventually include every driver on the Formula 1 grid. By providing information on who they are, where they are from, how they got into Formula 1, and what team they drive for, as well as any dynamic information for the current Formula 1 race weekend at the time.

 Users should be able to easily navigate the website, so the goal is to keep things clean and concise.
